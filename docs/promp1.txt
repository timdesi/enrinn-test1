Iâ€™d like you to develop an Azure Function that exposes the attached dataset in GeoJSON format as a Feature Collection API. This data will later be used to animate a GPS trace in Azure Maps.
For reference, the implementation should emulate the example provided in the Azure Maps samples repository:
ðŸ”— Animate a GPS Trace Example at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureMapsCodeSamples/blob/main/Samples/Animations/Animate%20a%20GPS%20trace/Animate%20a%20GPS%20trace.html
Requirements:
Azure Function:
Should serve the GeoJSON dataset through an API endpoint.
Follow Azure Function best practices for scalability and security. ( free tier to avoid any costs for you) 
Ensure logs track any AI-generated code prompts in Markdown format.
javascript/typescript 
Azure Maps Animation:
The web app should animate the provided dataset on Azure Maps as a moving GPS trace.

Deployment:
Deploy the web app as an Azure Static Web App.( free tier to avoid any costs for you) 
(Optional, extra points) Set up Terraform & GitHub Actions for infrastructure deployment.
Evaluation Criteria:
Proper use of Azure Function best practices.
Effective implementation using Azure technologies.
Clear prompting skills if any AI-generated code is used.
